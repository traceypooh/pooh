Sony P-Series
  
(specifically: win7 era P788K, 8&#8243; 1600&#215;768 display, 2B RAM, GMA 500 graphics, 64GB SSD)

I got this supercute [mini-laptop][1] last year

I had been using Ubuntu linux Lucid (10.4) and just upped to Meerkat (10.10). (Both were Netbook Edition).
  
I&#8217;d never gotten video acceleration to work before and was stuck w/ ~1-5 fps video most of the time.

Doing the widely suggested:

`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gma500/ppa && sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gma500/fix && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install poulsbo-driver-2d poulsbo-driver-3d poulsbo-config<br />
` 

bricked my vaio 8-( well, i mean, it gave me root login w/o X/windows ability but&#8230; 8-p)
  
but 2-3 apt-get remove, reinstalls, hunting google later, found the apparent saviour (I did 1000mb from 2000mb recommended [here][2]):

`sudo nano /etc/default/grub<br />
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash mem=1000mb acpi_osi=Linux"<br />
sudo update-grub`

booted clean! \*immediately\* got ability to use proprietary vaio accessory to output VGA to external monitor (a first!) and brightness up/down hotkeys working. (brightness to work even at all!)
  
but best of all, video and appearance \*and everything\* (moving windows, starting applications) was \*so much faster\* visually!

`cmd-line video playback with:<br />
sudo apt-get remove mplayer<br />
sudo apt-get install gnome-mplayer gecko-mediaplayer`

so this is \*all\* i have done, aside from starting w/ vanilla install (with just a few changes to help w/ SSD instead of HD) of lucid upgraded to meerkat.
  
(personally, i&#8217;m still working on getting suspend/resume to work (seems to work but the display doesn&#8217;t come back on &#8212; been like this the whole time) and to get hibernate to work &#8212; prolly will go with some kinda memory stick to dump to)

UPDATE!

suspend/resume working now with change to suggested &#8220;gma500 fix&#8221;

`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gma500/ppa && sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gma500/fix && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install poulsbo-driver-2d poulsbo-driver-3d poulsbo-config`

I think this additional suggestion may have fixed sleep/resume (but it&#8217;s possible it was just the gma500/fix related packages in live above:

sudo mv /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d/99video /usr/lib/pm-utils/99video
