OK, I&#8217;ve revamped my script to compile these tools:
     
ffmpeg
     
ffrobe
     
qt-faststart
     
mplayer
     
mencoder

on MacOS Lion, using the heads of the trees, with direct encoding support for:
     
x264
     
vpx / WebM

A nice recent update to ffmpeg is the ability to decode/read Apple ProRes, too!
