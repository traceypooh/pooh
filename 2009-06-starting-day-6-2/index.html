So far so good.
  
We made it safe and dry until now.
  
Today started light rain with wet tent.
  
It&#8217;s let up over breakfast mostly
  
so we are hoping hoping for a break
  
Today and crossing our fingers

Today&#8217;s highlights are Santa Barbara,
  
Hopefully dolphin coastal sightings,
  
And an ice cream stop &#8212; it&#8217;s
  
Normally super hot today!

Yesterday&#8217;s day 5 &#8220;red dress day&#8221; was
  
A blast even though it was a bit of a
  
Hard finish with hills and headwinds

Thanks all for your support, interest,
  
And comments!
