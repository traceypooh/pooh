WOOOOOWWWWW! Hunter *totally* surprised me on my favorite bike ride with a **PROPOSAL!**

We were riding my favorite ride, 5 of us, with our Thirsty Thursday weekly rider founders.

Everyone got me pretty good -- I thought we were just taking a fancy picture at the best vantage point ever! Jaw dropped! Hunter's crying; I'm crying. I Loved his speech!! The Ring is so perfect and so "me"! And it happened perfectly at the crossing of my favorite bike (Coast View) & hike (Dipsea) trails!

Thanks *so* much Drew U, Mike Wood & Michael Marano for making the secret day magical and for being part of Our Story!

My head is still reeling! We're hitting our 25th anniversary together -- our marriage is going to be great! ❤️❤️❤️

it only occurred to me after the Proposal and the YES!
that we still had our helmets on, hehe

The guys got us a bottle of bubbles to celebrate. 😻
I'm so glad everyone helped with the surprise and was part of our forever Special Day!
