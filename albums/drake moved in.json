We're especially luck to have gotten $$$$-worth of commercial chrome racks for free (and our garage is our pride of organization now).<br><br>  The house gets great sun and roasts up nicely in the afternoon to culminate with gorgeous sunsets over the bay and SF.  Our commute is our secret path and then a couple public staircases down to the cute Montclair village (to a coach bus to transbay terminal).  So far, we're pleased as punch!",
