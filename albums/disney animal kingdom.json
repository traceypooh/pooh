Animal Kingdom -- what a great park! \n\
I was seriously hesitant and expecting 8 hours of \"Can you feel the love tonight?\"  but instead it was great. \n\
 \n\
It is *totally* immersive, lush, and well laid out.  Best of all, there are great \"trek\" walks throughout the park  \n\
to see different exotic animals (think like way better than the best zoo you've seen). \n\
 \n\
The little \"asian\" and \"african\" villages are so convincing and cute. \n\
They even have a (thoughtfully, appropriately) roped off \"Ganges River\" scene. \n\
I mean, you look at the vistas and go  \n\
\"this is crazy!  i'm taking pictures of faked places in the real world!  but they're soooo well done!\" \n\
 \n\
 \n\
3 of my top 5 rides are at this park: \n\
Kilimanjaro Safaris (great animals in totally immersive world/safari) \n\
DINOSAUR (great!  perfect modern ride) \n\
It's Tough to be a Bug (stimulates 4 of the 5 senses!) \n\
