      "description":"<br>Animal Kingdom -- what a great park! <br>I was seriously hesitant and expecting 8 hours of \"Can you feel the love tonight?\"  but instead it was great. <br> <br>It is *totally* immersive, lush, and well laid out.  Best of all, there are great \"trek\" walks throughout the park to see different exotic animals (think like way better than the best zoo you've seen). <br> <br>The little \"asian\" and \"african\" villages are so convincing and cute.  They even have a (thoughtfully, appropriately) roped off \"Ganges River\" scene.  I mean, you look at the vistas and go \"this is crazy!  i'm taking pictures of faked places in the real world!  but they're soooo well done!\" <br> <br>3 of my top 5 rides are at this park: <br>Kilimanjaro Safaris (great animals in totally immersive world/safari) <br>DINOSAUR (great!  perfect modern ride) <br>It's Tough to be a Bug (stimulates 4 of the 5 senses!) <br>",
