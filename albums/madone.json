wow!  just got my new trek road bike.\n\
it's the first year Trek went with \"compact geometry\" (downslope tube) bike styling \n\
after winning the Tour de France with a slightly better version of this bike. \n\
\n\
Upgrading from an aluminum bike with carbon fork (hardtail) to this 100% carbon \n\
frame and fork is just incredible!  it absorbs bumps and road noise like a 70s \n\
bouncy caddy so you and your bum can keep riding for hours. \n\
\n\
it climbs and descends amazing.  trek has an incredible bike here. \n\
and now i do, too, yay! \n\
