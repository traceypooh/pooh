      "description":"wow!  just got my new trek road bike.  It's the first year Trek went with \"compact geometry\" (downslope tube) bike styling after winning the Tour de France with a slightly better version of this bike. <br><br>Upgrading from an aluminum bike with carbon fork (hardtail) to this 100% carbon frame and fork is just incredible!  It absorbs bumps and road noise like a 70s bouncy caddy so you and your bum can keep riding for hours. <br><br>It climbs and descends amazing.  Trek has an incredible bike here.  And now I do, too, yay! <br><br>I'm looking forward to the 1000s of miles of training for my first <a href=\"http://www.aidslifecycle.org/3287\">Aids Lifecycle</a> (7 day bikeride from SF to LA).",
