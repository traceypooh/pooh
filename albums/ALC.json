      "description":"<br><b>AIDS LifeCycle 7!</b> <br> <br>Our first time doing it, and definitely not our last! <br>We raised over $20,000 as part of the $11.6 million raised by the 2,500 riders plus 500 \"roadies\" for this weeklong event. <br>It was 7 days of biking (every day) to go from San Fran to LA in 545 miles (averaging 78 miles/day). <br> <br>We had a BLAST!  Touring CA was so beautiful!  We loved the community and the cause and were sad when it was over.  Still, we managed to bike *every mile* and avoid accidents and injury (thank goodness!)   Our very minor issues were: one flat tire, one bee sting (face!), two numb big toes (for week after ride), and some minor irritation/blister where you sit (that went away quickly). <br> <br><span style=\"font-family: normal;\"><b>THANK YOU TO OUR SUPPORTERS WHO DONATED!!</b> <br>WE COULD NOT HAVE DONE THIS RIDE WITHOUT ALL THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF OUR DONORS AND CURRENT AND PRIOR RIDERS WHO URGED US ON!</span> <br> <br>We will never forget this ride.  We will never forget the millions who are dying and suffering from AIDS and promise to do all we can to end this horrific pandemic. <br> <br>Love and Light! <br>--tracey and hunter (riders <a href=\"http://www.aidslifecycle.org/3287\">#3287</a> and <a href=\"http://www.aidslifecycle.org/2543\">#2543</a>). <br>",
