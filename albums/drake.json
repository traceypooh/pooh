    After over a year of looking, Tracey and Hunter close on a house! \n\
    It's cute and very close to Montclair (Oakland hills neighborhood) downtown with a nice SF view. \n\
    It's 1773 sq feet and we'd like to expand it an convert it into a spanish villa. \n\
    In a hot market, we got it under asking, woot! \n\
