hmm, what to make of this park?  well, the 30s retro hollywood theme is kinda cool  \n\
(although just drive around outside the studios at Burbank, CA for something similar ;-) \n\
 \n\
it's not *really* a studio anymore.  nothing's that impressive, and at least one  \n\
\"attraction\" really irked us.  \"Behind the Scenes - Narnia\" proved to be nothing more than a  \n\
\"making of\" short \"while-you-wait\" film plus a long trailer of the first film and then \n\
(the punchline) a long trailer for upcoming 2nd film.  Please! \n\
At least I got to see some White Witch stuff like her chariot and snow costume. \n\
(Tilda Swinton is *the* baddest villian ever and the best thing about Narnia 8-) \n\
 \n\
Star Wars characters made the park not useless.  Dinner at hollywood replica of \"The Brown Derby\"  \n\
had a great atmosphere and surprisingly, very good food, too. \n\
 \n\
1 of my top 5 rides is the \"Twilight Zone - Tower of Terror\".   \n\
Super great lead-up/walk in to the \"hotel\" and extra well done to the 100%! \n\
 \n\
(Star Tours is excellent fun, too, but didn't quite make my top 5). \n\
