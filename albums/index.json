Touring CA was so beautiful!  We loved the community and the cause and were sad when it was over.  Still, we managed to bike *every mile* and avoid accidents and injury (thank goodness!)   Our very minor issues were: one flat tire, one bee sting (face!), two numb big toes (for week after ride), and some minor irritation/blister where you sit (that went away quickly). <br> <br><span style=\"font-family: normal;\"><b>THANK YOU TO OUR SUPPORTERS WHO DONATED!!</b> <br>WE COULD NOT HAVE DONE THIS RIDE WITHOUT ALL THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF OUR DONORS AND CURRENT AND PRIOR RIDERS WHO URGED US ON!</span> <br> <br>We will never forget this ride.  We will never forget the millions who are dying and suffering from AIDS and promise to do all we can to end this horrific pandemic. <br> <br>Love and Light! <br>--tracey and hunter (riders <a href=\"http://www.aidslifecycle.org/3287\">#3287</a> and <a href=\"http://www.aidslifecycle.org/2543\">#2543</a>). <br>",

It is a memorial rememberance ride for the founder of the Positive Pedalers whom we sadly lost in 2001. <br> <br>We had great weather (about 10 miles of tough head and crosswind for one day) and as far as we heard, noone got hurt. Everyone was as usual incredibly friendly and supportive.  There was so much pretty countryside to bike through and take in that it's hard to believe that we biked it all. <br><br>Thanks especially to Wilfredo, Beau, Peter, and Bob -- our fabulous Training Ride Leaders of the Peds that we've ridden the most with who also did much or most of the the organizing. <br><br>I now *really* want to explore the Russian River area and do more north bay riding.

      "description":"hmm, what to make of this park?  well, the 30s retro hollywood theme is kinda cool  (although just drive around outside the studios at Burbank, CA for something similar ;-) <br> <br>it's not *really* a studio anymore.  nothing's that impressive, and at least one  \"attraction\" really irked us.  \"Behind the Scenes - Narnia\" proved to be nothing more than a \"making of\" short \"while-you-wait\" film plus a long trailer of the first film and then (the punchline) a long trailer for upcoming 2nd film.  Please!  At least I got to see some White Witch stuff like her chariot and snow costume. (Tilda Swinton is *the* baddest villian ever and the best thing about Narnia 8-) <br> <br>Star Wars characters made the park not useless.  Dinner at hollywood replica of \"The Brown Derby\" had a great atmosphere and surprisingly, very good food, too. <br> <br>1 of my top 5 rides is the \"Twilight Zone - Tower of Terror\".  Super great lead-up/walk in to the \"hotel\" and extra well done to the 100%! <br> <br>(Star Tours is excellent fun, too, but didn't quite make my top 5).",

Best of all, there are great \"trek\" walks throughout the park to see different exotic animals (think like way better than the best zoo you've seen). <br> <br>The little \"asian\" and \"african\" villages are so convincing and cute.  They even have a (thoughtfully, appropriately) roped off \"Ganges River\" scene.  I mean, you look at the vistas and go \"this is crazy!  i'm taking pictures of faked places in the real world!  but they're soooo well done!\" <br> <br>3 of my top 5 rides are at this park: <br>Kilimanjaro Safaris (great animals in totally immersive world/safari) <br>DINOSAUR (great!  perfect modern ride) <br>It's Tough to be a Bug (stimulates 4 of the 5 senses!) <br>",

      "description":"Four of us drove up to the Sonoma wine country\r\n(Alexander Valley mostly) on a day that wound up being super hot\r\nfor a relaxing bikeride.  After being in the 100s, we decided\r\nto bike up to the promising sounding Lake Sonoma and then\r\njumped into it spontaneously in our reduced bike clothes!  8-)\r\n\r\nA *gorgeous* bikeride that we plan to do again!",
