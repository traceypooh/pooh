THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU

donors to my AIDS LifeCycle8 bikeride!

I took about 500 photos myself during the seven days of riding. Hunter also took about that many photos, too. I will make a combined album soon and edit a video as well and put links to them on this site.

However, for now, you can see    **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">~100 of my best photo</span>**<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>s</strong></span> on my public albums here:
