Well, Hunter and I made it home safe and sound last night!

We finished just before the course formally closed, yesterday (saturday) around 3pm.
  
(A lot of us were late due to two accident-caused road closure/delays and then Hunter and I decided to sneak off course a block to reward ourselves with Peets mocha freddos ðŸ˜Ž just before riding in. Â  We flew from LAX to SFO and then BART-ed and were home just after midnight. Â Was sooo nice to see the kitties again and get things airing out!

#### Some interesting summary thoughts:

  * **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Day 6 got entirely cancelled</span>** ****and we had to be bussed from camp to camp. We originally thought it was due to the uphill and downhill being deemed &#8220;too dangerous&#8221; in the rain by the CHP, but it was actually because that pass got closed temporarily due to rain related accidents and only ~250 riders (~10%) made it out on the rainy road before the &#8220;hold&#8221;. We had a 3 hour permit to cone off a single lane of route 101/1 on this narrow &#8220;no shoulder&#8221; bridge, and by the time the pass was reopened, not all the riders were likely to make it through the pass. CHP didn&#8217;t want to extend the times so they asked us to cancel that day. **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">*First time* that has happened in 16 years of LifeCycle / AIDSRide </span>****! Â ** Of course, the irony is that the rains stopped early in the morning by about 8am, and Hunter and I (and the riders who have similar pace &#8212; at least 50% of the riders) could have easily made that road closure for a really wonderfully beautiful perfect biking weather day.
  * Although the weather was a bit ominous at times, we **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">only got about three 5-10 minute very light sprinkles of rain</span>** while biking or in the nonsleeping hours of camp. Â It did rain one morning pretty good &#8212; causing a lot of tents to flood. Â We prepared a bit better with a tarp under our tent (and had a thick air mattress) so we didn&#8217;t get tooo wet.
  * I was slightly crabby or something Day1 (due to lack of sleep and foggy wet start) but every day pretty much got \*more\* beautiful and better as it went on. Â If fact, I loved every day but day6 (which wasn&#8217;t awful &#8212; just disappointing that the route got cancelled.)
  * This year the biggest difference was the fact that while last year was hot and dry nearly every single day, **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">this ride was a slight bit cool (though nicely never cold at all) and *very* humid (comparatively) every day</span>****.** Â Strange this time of year!
  * **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Day 5</span>** was a big change of course this year. Â Last year was a total cakewalk (or &#8220;champagne ride&#8221; as the pros sometime call last day of Tour de France ðŸ˜Ž ) at only 43 miles and limited hills (w/ so so scenery). **Â <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This year was a noteably tougher nearly 70 miles where the ride to lunch was *jaw droppingly* gorgeous (riding wine country a al the movie &#8220;Sideways&#8221; into Solvang for the first time in ALC history) and fantastic</span>.** Â However, after lunch was quite challenging where we headed directly westward for Lompoc &#8212; which meant the picking up strong wind was all headwind on flats and downhills and we were working hard on a \*lot\* of uphills. Â So there was **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8220;no recovery&#8221; period from lunch to camp</span>.** Â 

Overall, once again an utterly fantastic ride!

We knew so many people this year it was like a rolling party of socializing and eating (well with determined-to-finish work on the bike in between ðŸ™‚ ). Â It&#8217;s soooo nice to have found this wonderful community of people who care for others and everyone in the Ride. Â I&#8217;ve been thinking it&#8217;s a lot like the communities people find in churches (having grown up Methodist but now non-religious).
