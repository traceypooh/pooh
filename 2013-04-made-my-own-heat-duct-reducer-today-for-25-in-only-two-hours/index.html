<center>custom heat duct reducer</center>
Using a 24&#8243; x 36&#8243; sheet of (intended for ducting) sheet metal (~$10) and rivet tool + rivets (~$15) I was able to take a 14&#8243; x 8&#8243; opening and create a 4&#8243; deep reducer down to a 14&#8243; x 4&#8243; opening.

This way, this can be an **insert** into an existing duct and "boot"/box that takes an 8&#8243; pipe of heat into a 4&#8243; deep 14&#8243; x 8&#8243; box.  It can then exhale the heat into a 14&#8243; x 4" vent.

Why the insert you ask?  Hint: house was built in 1960.  Guess what the most common way to insulate ductwork \*and\* boxes/registers/boots was back then?   ASBESTOS, YAY!

So while we don't know it is for sure, it sure looks like it (inspectors clued us in, t00).   So we not gonna mess w/ the box/ductwork that is in relatively good shape and not cut it, etc.

This is all part of a Bigger Project of redecoration we are doing at the bunny fort.
