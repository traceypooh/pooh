OK, so here&#8217;s the problem. Â I think the Apple Watch is too small (but it&#8217;s weight is &#8220;just right&#8221;!) and I dislike the bands. Â In fact, I never wear &#8220;normal&#8221; watches anymore &#8212; I greatly prefer nice and wide uniform width leather cuffs.<figure id="attachment_1418" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1418" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

[<img class="wp-image-1418 size-medium" src="//poohBot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2051-e1434680777490-225x300.jpg" alt="IMG_2051" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://poohBot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2051-e1434680777490-225x300.jpg 225w, https://poohBot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2051-e1434680777490-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />][1]<figcaption id="caption-attachment-1418" class="wp-caption-text">finished product</figcaption></figure> 

So I found (and ordered) this cute [cheapie < $20 adapter][2] (which as I thought, comes direct from China). Â The black can chip/flake a little (it&#8217;s not anodized into the metal well), which they know/cop to &#8212; but it&#8217;s so cheap so who cares? Â ðŸ˜‰

Next I ordered a few different bands from my [\*favorite\* watch (and fun! Â also cheap!) store][3]Â (I&#8217;ve rocked their watches for years now, and have fun getting different styles. Â Their website is a bit slow, but they have great selection). Â  I settled on this (crazy cheap clearance!) item [black tattoo-like watch cuff band][4] (which nicely didn&#8217;t come with a watch I didn&#8217;t need).

My thinking was to get something at least as wide as the watch (1.5&#8243; wide band) but would set off/partially incognito the black aluminum 42mm watch casing. Â The other two bands were an even wider brown one (but it just was a bit more plain than I&#8217;d hope for, less &#8220;me&#8221;) and a 3&#8243;+ \*really\* wide black one (but it looked a little too S&M or something &#8212; again not really &#8220;me&#8221;). Â Thankfully Nemesis was great about letting me return them in exchange for another band and watch I wanted (since I was about two weeks past the return deadline!)

So you:

  * center the watch (charger is easiest) on the back of the band (those rivets you see below hold the &#8220;snap parts&#8221; for this particular cuff &#8212; that&#8217;s a more ideal setup than a looped kind of other way to secure the watch w/ a single snap underneath &#8212; because we&#8217;re going to need to cut out a hole so the [watch can touch (and basically &#8220;see&#8221; your skin)][5]
  * trace the charger with a pen
  * cut the circle out with an xacto knife or similar
  * slide out the old watch band
  * assemble the new watch adapter (you can see it in pictures below slid and locked into the watch)
  * snap in in!

Now you can charge it through the hole nicely, and it should make good skin contact and thus stay unlocked once it&#8217;s on.<figure id="attachment_1416" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1416" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

[ I happen to like also wearing the watch on my left wrist, but face on my underside of the wrist (also makes the watch more innocuous / disappears &#8212; and more of a &#8220;surprise&#8221; when you &#8220;wrist up and twist&#8221; to others 8-). Â So I made my settings say the watch was on my right wrist (since the &#8220;bend up arm and twist&#8221; motion is more like the other side when you wear the watch this way. ]
