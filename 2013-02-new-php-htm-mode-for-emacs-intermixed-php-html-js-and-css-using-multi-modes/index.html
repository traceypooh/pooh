I finally formalized, cleaned up, and packaged up my current emacs editing setup for files with intermixed PHP, HTML, JS/javascript, and CSS code all in the same file.  It uses an existing but rarely used technique called &#8220;multi-mode&#8221; and sets &#8220;trigger points&#8221; for switching the &#8220;major mode&#8221; of the buffer as your cursor moves through the code.

A nice thing about this approach is that you can always glance down anytime you are editing to see which mode you are in (or the emacs lisp code \*thinks\* you are in).  You can also fork/edit the single &#8220;.el&#8221; lisp file to add/update the triggers for various modes.
