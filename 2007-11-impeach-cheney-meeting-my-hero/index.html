Hunter and I got to [hear Naomi Wolf speak][2] about her new book, along with
  
**Daniel Ellsberg (pictured left)**, the leaker of the &#8220;Pentagon Papers&#8221; (which helped
  
end the Vietnam War). The event was sponsored by KPFA and featured a moderator and another journalist.

All parties agreed we need to [impeach Cheney][3] [impeach Cheney][4] ASAP!
  
**Torture is illegal** under domestic and international laws, and the Geneva Convention. **Warantless wiretapping is illegal**. For these two reasons alone (but many more), Cheney should be impeached and tried for high crimes and misdemeanors!

Take action [now!][5]

From [The End of America &#8211; Letter of Warning to a Young Patriot][6]:

Ten Steps to dictatorship &#8212; happening now in America:

  1. Invoke a terrifying internal and external enemy.
  2. Create secret prisons where torture takes place.
  3. Develop a thug caste or paramilitary force not answerable to citizens.
  4. Set up an internal surveillance system.
  5. Harass citizens&#8217; groups.
  6. Engage in arbitrary detention and release.
  7. Target key individuals.
  8. Control the press.
  9. Declare all dissent to be treason.
 10. Suspend the rule of law.
