Just watched Oliver Stone&#8217;s [JFK][1] for the first time last night. 

I&#8217;d seen the recent [Discovery Channel JFK programming][2] that was excellent.
  
The \*really\* amazing thing was that when JFK movie came out, most of the media and Prez Ford (who was in the Warren Commission which did the post-assasination cover-up, er, I mean, investigation) denounced it. Now that more is declassified, most everything has shown to be true. Multiple shooters!! 

I&#8217;m progressive.
  
and i vote.
  
and i volunteer.
  
and i&#8217;m helping to take down the Bush Crime Family.
