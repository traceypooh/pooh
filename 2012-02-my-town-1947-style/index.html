Our amazing next door neighbor, [Reenie Raschke][1], the super talented photographer has lovingly chronicled our town in a black-and-white pictorial called &#8220;[My Town Montclair][2]&#8220;.

We saw her present slides and background from her book last night at our local indie bookstore. She passed around this gem of an original 60+ year old newspaper showing our downtown as it was!
