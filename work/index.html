<p>October 2004, Tracey returned to work once again with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster_Kahle">Brewster Kahle</a>
at the now fully nonprofit
<a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a> to help continue the largest
digital library in the world.
Tracey is working on their website and the storage system for the collection materials, as well as side digital video projects.
She is primarily developing in PHP, JSON, and CSS.
</p>

<p>Tracey worked at
<a href="http://www.imarkets.com">Intelligent Markets</a>
from 2000 to 2004 as a java software architect,
responsible for efficient servers as well as the Oracle and Sybase database and JDBC layers.
She was also in charge of server configuration, setup, and its build system,
converting a legacy 10,000 line "make" system to a modern Ant/XML solution.
She was inventor on two patent applications.
</p>

<p>Tracey worked at
<a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a> and
<a href="http://www.alexa.com">Alexa Internet</a> from 1996 to 2000, building

      (believed to have since become
      <a href="http://www.nuance.com">Nuance</a>).
      There Tracey used her formal background and training in
      machine vision and image analysis to analyze the contents of documents in
      efforts to empower computers to understand the world of images in a manner
      similar to humans (for example Optical Character Recognition).
      Tracey was also their webmaster.
      She was inventor on four image analysis patents.
