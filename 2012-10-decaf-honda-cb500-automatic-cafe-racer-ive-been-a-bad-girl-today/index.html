Today Hunter helped me inspect, test-drive, buy, and drive 100+ miles home from a mom-n-pop custom bike modifier in California&#8217;s central valley.

We avoided the 5 and all freeways and started out with about an hour of &#8220;country roads&#8221; and farm roads that were mostly straight and flat. Next we nearly ran out of gas but recovered thanks to the &#8220;reserve switch&#8221; to fillup in Tracy. Finally, we started the fun curvy and up-and-down stuff through the northwest backside of Mt. Diablo and had a late lunch in Clayton. We wrapped it up through Moraga, and then our favorite twisty mountain pass up Pinehurst to Skyline Blvd and home

What an wild day!

I&#8217;ve named her &#8220;decaf&#8221; since she&#8217;s an automatic (with just &#8220;lo&#8221; and &#8220;hi&#8221; gears, no clutch) \*and\* a cafe racer style modified bike. I&#8217;m really pleased she did so well on the first ambitious ride all the way home.

Here&#8217;s some bike porn / pix!
