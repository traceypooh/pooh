I did it!

Take a SketchUp model into the new iOS ARKit. Using my SketchUp home remodel and Apple&#8217;s ARKit (beta) for augmented reality.
  
**
  
Goal: import a model (in this case, a remodel) to overlay onto existing real world that you can walk around and &#8216;experience&#8217; and compare.

You can see the results in the youtube video as I step through the trickier setup parts and things that took the longest to sort out.
