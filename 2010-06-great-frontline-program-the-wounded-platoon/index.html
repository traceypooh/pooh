I just listened to this as a podcast and then watched the video online after that.  It's a really interesting slice and view into the Iraq war -- where they just focus on one specific platoon.  "Wounded" refers more to the psychological rather than physical wounds -- although the latter relates to the former&#8230;

The original materials, background, and discussion can be [seen here](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/woundedplatoon/).

The 7 chapter program can be seen in its entirety here:
