Whups, my new speedo&#8217;s turn indicator LED was only going on when left signal was running.

Thankfully, found [this post on hondatwins][1] that mentioned the orange and light blue bike lines were actually active lines for when left or right turn signal was on &#8212; not that they were positive and negative general lines. It also mentioned a (cheap/simple, yay!) fix to use two 3-amp diodes and tie them in together. A quick putt-putt to Radioshack and $2 later&#8230;

Success!

I focus mainly on that in this image, but also some other related notes.<figure id="attachment_1218" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1218" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

I also have my new speedo&#8217;s neutral LED light now turning on when bike is on (but not running) &#8212; will see tomorrow if it \*also\* properly goes \*off\* when shift up when bike is running.
