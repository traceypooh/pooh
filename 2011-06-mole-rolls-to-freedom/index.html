hunter and i were biking the other day parallel to the caldecott tunnel / 24, and were horrified to see a mole, midday, just rolling over and over again down the hill/pavement. we think maybe a huge rainstorm drove it out and it got lost trying to not drown on the road. they are \*\*ALL HANDS\*\*, no limbs! poor thing was made to dig/swim only, not walk/run. 

after picking up the panicked little thing, we gently tossed it into dirt, but it looked just unhappy. intuition kicked in and seemed like the soil was too hard so found some damper stuff to move it to. presto! in seconds our little dirt scuba diver was self-buried in moist topsoil and happy. hunter points out "bird food&#8230;" but it's a warm and furry mammal creature!!
