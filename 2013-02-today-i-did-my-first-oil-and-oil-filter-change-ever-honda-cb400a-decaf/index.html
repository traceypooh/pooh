Russ and I changed our motorcycle&#8217;s oil and oil filters today.  This was the first time I&#8217;ve ever changed oil in a vehicle &#8212; I guess it sort of was a life goal I figured I&#8217;d never get around to &#8212; part of understanding cars/bikes more!   So it was a nice way to kick off the start of our 3-day holiday weekend.

The actual work on my bike was quite simple:

  * 1 ratchet-able bolt as the drain plug to release most of the used oil into oil drip pan
  * 1 ratchet-able bolt underneath to release the bike&#8217;s oil pan and oil filter section

<span style="font-size: 16px;"> Russ helped figure out those bolts which I could confirm with a shop manual PDF.  Harder was sorting out what oil and filter to get/use and getting them.  I went with:</span>

  * <span style="line-height: 16px;">Valvoline SAE 10W-40 Motorcycle oil (for 4-strokes; non-synthetic; ideal for wet clutches) (AutoZone/Walmart)</span>
  * K&N KN-111 oil filter (local motorcycle shop)

Putting everything back couldn&#8217;t be easier &#8212; slipped on new filter to bolt/cover, ratchet-ed the two bolts back in, and poured in ~3 quarts of oil.  I was happy parts were all in good shape and aside from some relatively dirty oil, no badness or surprises for my 35 year old bike.  Phew!<figure id="attachment_1281" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1281" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignleft">
