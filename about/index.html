# About this site
**[edit Sep 2019]**
Migrated to [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) -- a static site engine written in Go.<br/>
Using xxx theme

I've finally taken the plunge to the ubiquitous
<a href="http://wordpress.org">wordpress</a> as the basis of my completely
rewritten (June 2010) website, using a custom plugin and custom new HTM/CSS/JS
"<a href="//poohBot.com/2015/05/06/slide-responsively-minimal-standalone-htmcssjs-inspired-by-sliding-door-from-wayne-connor">slide-responsively</a>"
that I wrote, which is inspired by
"<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/sliding-door">sliding-door</a>"
theme.  That gives me the bloglike nature, comments, search, and such.


Aside from customizing the theme, I took a lot of my old pages that were the
basis of my old site, converted them from HTML+JS to PHP+HTML and setup some hooks
for these pages to render using my static PHP files for the content of the
"page/post content" (the page content is "empty" in the wordpress DB for these
pages).  This allows me nicely to have a small set of static pages I mostly
manage and edit externally, but they still get the overall theme, comments,
tags, and such.
