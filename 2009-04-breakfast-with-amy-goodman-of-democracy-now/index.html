Amy Goodman, host of [Democracy Now][2]!,  is on tour this month across the country.  She visited San Francisco for two days this week.  My boss, Brewster Kahle from [Internet Archive][3], knew that I am a raving fan of Amy and her amazing show of independent journalism. He was kind enough to invite me along to a **long breakfast discussion with Amy**.

Brewster and Amy found a common interest on issues of the potential monopoly of Google books, so she scheduled a followup discussion the next day with Brewster on Amy&#8217;s show &#8220;[Democracy Now!][4]&#8221; (for likely broadcasting Apr20-25). In person, Amy is an incredibly sweet and inquisitive individual. She is brilliant as well as thoughtful, generous and full of grace. I was thrilled to meet her in person and see how a part of her day goes. I look up to her tremendously as an [award-winning][5] pioneer in the field of journalism.
