I&#8217;ve loved this cute local art feature at my bart-to-bus stop
  
Captions are:
  
&#8220;I&#8217;m here to fix your car&#8221;
  
&#8220;But I don&#8217;t have a car!!&#8221;
  
and now it&#8217;s even more awesome with the tagged line over it
  
&#8220;Bankers took it&#8221;
  
Go #OccupyWallSt !
