2000 mile roadtrip, the first 800 was Oakland, CA to Sedona, AZ, in 1 day. The high plain desert by Grand Canyon had a blizzard as we descended into Sedona. I'd always wanted to visit this adventurous beauty!

Checking in under darkness, it was a delight to find out at sunrise our hotel room had a balcony looking _right out at_ the main show of dazzling striated red rock buttes and canyons!

It was supposed to rain - we got lucky! So we did a jaw-droppingly beautiful mountain bike ride with the bikes & gear we packed before a coffee.

A biker friend mentioned a trail course: Thunder Mountain => Tea Cup => Adobe Jack.

We accidentially started a bit later at the Andante & Thunder Mountain intersection.  Thunder Mountain was a black diamond â—† but Andante was an easier blue ðŸŸ¦, cutting off the worst parts of Thunder Mountain.
So we did [Andante and the start of Tea Cup](https://www.strava.com/activities/11086608287).
That took us an hour door-to-door from the hotel.  We had to get used to the rocks (sometimes the move!) and pokey cacti waiting to "high five" us if we tipped off the singletrack trails.

The scenery is just _OH MY GAWD_.  We're biking right up at the start of the buttes - it's like a fairytale!

Delighted with our first outing, getting a coffee & treat.

After some mid-day _stuff_, I had the brilliant idea to figure out where all the "Pink JEEP" tours were heading off to, continuously throught the day.  So we found Schnebly Hill Road, named after Sedona's founder.  I turns into full off-road rock gardens right quick -- so we had a few miles of found bouncing all over the place :D

Gorgeous unlimited blue skies, at least ten degrees warmer.
