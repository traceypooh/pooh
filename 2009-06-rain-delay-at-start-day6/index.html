Well we are all waiting to roll after CA Highway Patrol
  
Shut down the course due to early rain.
  
Not sure if we&#8217;ll get cleared to ride
  
Was an early accident on only
  
big downhill of the day.

Rumor is now day may be cancelled
  
and will have to bus 2000+ riders
  
and bikes. We will see&#8230;
