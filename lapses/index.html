I've been interested in time lapse photography ever since our family started
playing with cameras and taking and showing 8mm films and stills.
My mom's parents were professional photographers and developers and so my
mom got us kids started early.  My family has used so many cameras over time
that my twin, a professional filmmaker, has rescued a great many and made
a "musuem" in the basement of my parents house.

I've always liked how varying the time of flickering images can completely
change the feel or let you see or experience something you couldn't see
yourself, even when it happened while you were there.
For example, watching the stars in a moonless night
<a href="https://archive.org/details/meteorocino">"spin" around the North
Star</a> is something breathtaking and,
to me, almost unbelievable.  You speed up the playback or time axis, and
suddenly it is brilliantly plain and clear.

Just before small digital cameras started coming out, I bought a miniDV
Sony camcorder and was determined to have it take high-quality still frames
for later assembly into time lapse videos with my computer.

Over 10 years later, and I'm still having fun with ffmpeg and mplayer
(although I've moved from win to mac) and with PoohBot Pictures.
I've expanded to other cameras and different techniques, but overall,
The Idea remains the same.
