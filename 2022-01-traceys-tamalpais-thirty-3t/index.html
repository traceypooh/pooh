Wow. OMG. Words. Just had the *insanely ambitous* and most fun bikeride I've had in 15 years!  While I'm [zero-ing in on what gravel bike to buy](gravel), Hunter let me borrow his 3T Exploro Racemax new gravel bike for a ride together on a 3-day weekend.  I shot for the moon -- "let's go up Mount Tamalpais (if I even can) and try to get down the other side and ride around back to the start".  About 30 miles.  I haven't been off-road, _really_ in 25 years (with brief exception of college reunion mountain biking in Sun Valley, ID, in Sept., with my college 'mates).  Will she make it?  Will she crash?  And OMG how big are those rocks in the "trails" after rerouting from goole maps fail?!

Did I mention over 3000 feet of climbing, all offroad, and most of the miles offroad?

Let's start the day right - my favorite brunch of be bim bap at Sunnyside Kitchen, Mill Valley, forgoing my favorite soju-based bloody mary for a "doping" full-strength latte ;-)

Gearing up in the Redwoods - let's do this!

Grinning ear-to-ear -- entering "Old Railroad Grade Fire Road" and get to try out the chunky tires 3T gravel bike and see how I can do uphill :)

So far, so good.  Not a cakewalk, but geez this bike is capable climbing!

Woohoo!  Arriving at the section I've hiked a few times before and know well.  View is getting bananas and I've got lots of energy to go

The sky and scenery was so amazing.  Brushing 70F degrees in the sun, almost no wind, _in january_ :)

Pretty sizeable loose rocks was the norm all the way up.

We just hit legendary West Point Inn -- only accessible to hiker and bikers.  It's the furthest I've been up Mt. Tam so am eager to see what's left

We did it!  Hit the peak and the "Gravity Car" awesome display with historical photos of the amazing "the car glides down with a brake lever and _that's it_" railroad that used to be here (and what we just biked).

Planning our descent.  Heading to Lake Lagunitas over my left shoulder.  We had to improvise a bit to get to "Eldridge Grade" from the top, after google maps directed us to somewhere impossible.

Thanks baby!  I am so soooo happy today and getting such a great way to _really_ try out a gravel bike!

Eldridge Grade was a bee-yatch!  Holy crap, from the start, we had to walk a couple hundred feet of impassable, _terrifying_ descents.  And it didn't get much better.  I was clamped, _horrified_ on the brakes, trying desperately to not fall hard left or right and crash into _huge_ rocks, boulders, and loose all over the place.  I had no idea it would be this bad!  Thankfully, we finally made it to some fire roads that were much more doable.  Still _very_ challenging, but by then, I had figured out how to get into the "drops" on the handlebars, descending more like a cat on all fours.  You smooth the bumps out with your arms and legs, leting the rest of your body float and barely touch the seat.  And you have 10x more braking power.

Celebratory beers and apps in Mill Valley!  I can't believe we did it and we didn't crash or get hurt.  It was _super_ dicey, requiring _absolute_ concentration in the first 45m (maybe half) of the descent.  I'm so impressed by what gravel bikes can do these days!

Here's what I would recommend to *avoid* the brutal downhill parts -- and can't wait to do next!
