ouchie!

A steel cruiser bike roared blindly out of a blind drive and ran into me.  The impact &#8220;taco-ed&#8221; (crumpled) my wheel and pitched me over the handle bars and the 2nd bike. I hit the pavement, but managed to not break anything or hit my head. I scraped up my fingers, tore up 4 fingernails, and scraped my elbow and knee. Later we&#8217;d learn it was all surface stuff and only my front wheel needed replacing._ **Amazingly lucky to have had so little damage!**_

I was prolly doing 10-15 mph; other rider maybe 7-10.  All of this happened right in front of Hunter&#8217;s horrified eyes!
