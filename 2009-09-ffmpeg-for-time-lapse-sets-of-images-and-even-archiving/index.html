I now use the [FFMPEG][1] [package][2] compiled locally on my Mac Leopard laptop. 

If you want to take a bunch of JPEG images, you can turn them into a &#8220;motion JPEG&#8221; AVI video file (which is ideal for time-lapse). What&#8217;s neat about ffmpeg, is you can turn a directory of JPEGs into an AVI and later recreate the JPEGs from the AVI. 

Thus, I can take 100-1000 JPEG images from a &#8220;shoot&#8221; and create a video time-lapse of all the JPEG images in a given subdir in a command-line shell (terminal):
      
      `ffmpeg -r 6 -i "%04d.jpg" -an -vcodec copy out.avi`

Even cooler, you can go directly back to \*the same JPEG\* images like so (this is where you can see it is a lossless conversion from JPEGs to Motion JPEG and back):
  
    `ffmpeg -i out.avi -vcodec copy "%04d.jpg"<br />
` 

&#8220;-r 6&#8221; is the framerate, ie: &#8220;make the video play 6 JPEG images per second&#8221;.
  
It doesn&#8217;t get much nicer than that! Not to mention, the encoding is FAST! I recently moved from mencoder/mplayer to ffmpeg since you can specify a complete copy of the input JPEGs (lossless from the source) as well as compress them down a bit (as you like).

For the lossless conversion, the (not entirely obvious) \*key\* to success is to use the &#8220;-vcodec copy&#8221; \*after\* the source file(s). 

You can get this running on Windows with Cygwin, Mac with terminal, and any linux distribution like Ubuntu.
