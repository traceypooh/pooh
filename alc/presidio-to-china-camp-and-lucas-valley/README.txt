this route is *very* approximate for a bunch o' reasons:

1) no bike paths on maps.google yet in N bay!
2) cannot "walk" across GG bridge
3) seems like google maps fatals around returning thru ross so had to reverse first ~340 GPS points
   and append to end of the ones returned (only returned ~ first 45 miles of route)
4) uses highways and other places in lieu of bike paths
5) missing ~1 mile segment from ~white's hill/fairfax-ish to sir francey drake & red hill rd...
